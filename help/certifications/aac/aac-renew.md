# Förnya din [!DNL Adobe Advertising]-certifiering

{{renewals-hold}}

<!--

When you pass a certification exam, your certification is valid for two years.

We're happy to announce that you are now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. It involves using on-demand Experience League courses and tutorials - simply complete three activities to renew your certification at no cost. You must renew before your certification expires, or you will need to take the full exam to become certified again.
